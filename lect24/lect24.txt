Angular

execution begins at main.ts

Angular Module = Directives + Pipes + Services

Every Angular Application must have atleast one module

To tell Angular a particular class is a module we use decorator called @NgModule

declarations: provides all the components in the module

@Component
	selector: the custom tag 
	templateUrl: link to the HTML template
	styleUrls: link to style sheets

.spec files are test cases

use npm start to start the project (it internally called ng serve)

src > styles.css is global css
