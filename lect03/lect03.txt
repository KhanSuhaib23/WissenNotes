Lecture 3 - Java (10/06/2019)

Recommended Java Heirarchy Structure


top-level (API)               : interfaces / No Implementation
middle-level (Common Methods) : abstract classes / Partial Implementation of the common methods
bottom-level (Logic)          : normal classes / Rest of the implementations 


1 interface can extends multiple interfaces
1 class can implements multiple interfaces
1 class can however extends only 1 class

abstract classes don't need to implement all methods of inerface it implements


For protected to be accessible then it either has to be in the same package or be child object.
Either one of these or both

Override

Exact same parameters and return type
Same or increased access specifier (public > protected > default > private)
