PL-SQL

	-> Procedural Language (PL) extension to SQL
	-> subprogram = code = block
	-> SQL first executes then the result goes to PL/SQL engine


BEGIN to END executable area

If we have a named block it is a PL/SQL object

To actually allow to view output we have to do this every session

set serveroutput on;

Built in oracle package

dbms_output.put_line(<string>)

scope of varialbe is towwards the upward direction (program < session < instance )

ie check program first if not declared then to session and so on ... not found then error

bind variable declare

	variable <name> <datatype>

	to use in PL/SQL 

	:[g|b]_<name>

	to get all the bind variables

	variable;

	to print the variable

	print <var-name>;
