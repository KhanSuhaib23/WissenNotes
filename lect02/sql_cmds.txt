show user; // show user
conn sys as sysdba; // connect as a sys user
conn <user-name>; // connect as a user
desc <table name>; // strcutre of the table

sys tables
	-> dba_users // meta data to stores info of all the users of the db

	-> tab // stores all the tables

user_xyz works for all schemas
all_xyx

dba_xyz works only for sysdba 
v$xyz

After getting the structure we can simple select from it to get info

we will first do

	select username, create, account_status from dba_users

Now we can see SCOTT and HR which we will be using

schema name (logical name) and user name (physical name) will always be the same

alter user <user-name> identified by <new-password> account [lock|unlock]

We try to log into hr

alter user hr identified by pass account unlock

To connect directly to a remote database

	sqlplus <user-name>/<password>@<database-name>

To no enter password seperately

	> sqlplus 
	> <user-name>/<password>



orcl is the database.
there could be multiple databases.
each database has several schemas/users 
schemas are basically work areas inside a database

schemas are concept specific to oracle.

Inside schemas we have tables.

Each user (that is same as schema) can access other database under its credential if it has access. [remote database]
