try-catch-finally

finally executes always no matter if exception or not
finally also executes if you are returning prematurly

try
{
	// code
	return;
}
catch (Exception e)
{
	
}
finally
{
	// executes before we return from the method as well
}


finally doesn't execute on termination though


try
{
	// code
	System.exit(-1);
}
catch (Exception e)
{
	
}
finally
{
	// doesn't executes before we terminate
}

checked vs unchecked exceptions

checked when you want to force where to handle the exception

unchecked when you want to choose where to handle the exception

throwables
	exception 
		runtime exceptions
	error
