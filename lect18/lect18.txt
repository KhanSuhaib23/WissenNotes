@Entity
@Table (name = "", schema = "")
@Id
@TableGenerator(name="table_gen", table="pk_table", pkColumnName="next_val")
@GeneratedValue (strategy = GenerationType.---)
@Column (name = "")
@Lob
@Enumerated (EnumType.---)

Composite Primary Key
Make a class with them
Make that class @Embedable and implements Serializable and must have equals and hash code method

Include a variable of that inside the class and mark as @EmbededId

Composite Column (Entity to Non Entity)

same except use @Embedded

If 2 embedded object of the same type then use

@AttributeOverride(name = "og column" column=@Column(name="mapped column"))

If you want to store a list of stuff we need to normalize
Hiberate does that for us

@ElementCollection
@CollectionTable (name="other table name", joinColumns = {@JoinColumn(name = {"name1", "name2"})})


Entity to Entity

uni-directional - can know transaction from account cannot know account from transaction
bi-directional - can know from one to other

types of associated

1-1
