**Observer/Listener/Event Pattern**

* Consider a scenario where there are several objects that depend upon something happening in a particular object
* When a particular event happen in the given object all the other objects must be notified of this event 
* this is known as the Observer Pattern or Event Driven Design

* Say the objects that must be notified of the event are called Listeners
* And the object who they listen to is called the Target
* To implement this the Target must maintain a list of all the Listener
* It should also contain methods to add or remove the Listeners
* The Listeners on the other hand must implement an interface that allows Target to communicate with them

* Instead of each Target having to implement it could also inherit from some base class

~~~~~~~~~~~~~ java

interface Listener {
    void message(String message); // standard for Target to communicate to the Listeners
}

interface TargetInterface {

    void addListener(Listener Listener);
    void removeListener(Listener listener);

    void messageAll(String message); // message all the listeners
}

abstract class Target implements TargetInterface {

    List<Listener> listeners;

    public Target() {
        listeners = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
    }

    void addListener(Listener Listener) {
        listeners.add(listener);
    }

    void removeListener(Listener listener) {
        listeners.remove(listener);
    }

    void messageAll(String message) {

        for (int i = 0; i &lt; listeners.length(); i++) {
            listeners.get(i).message(message);
        }

    }

}

~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* now anyone that want to be a Listener it implements the Listener interface and implements the one method
* anyone wanting to be the target extends the Target
* then after instantiatin the necessary objects
* listeners are add to the target using the functions

!!! note
    Instead of sending a String, we can also create an Event [marker] interface that we pass through.<br>
    The the programmer can implement that Event to create their own. <br>
    They can then pass these interface and using casting can actually pass information.

!!! note
    marker interface are interfaces with nothing. <br>
    they are just used to mark a class/interface that is tagging them.
