**Java Exceptions**

Exceptions are unexpected distrubance that changes the control flow of program

*Reasons for exceptions*

* invalid input
* IO problems
* SQL issues
* Network issues
* condition fails
* ...

*What happens?*

* by default runtime terminates
* so we must handle the exception and when possible recover from it
* this is done using proper exception handling

*Advantages of Exceptions over traditional Error Handling*

* Seperating Error Handling Code from Normal Code

C Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ c

int function() {
    // do something
    if (cond) {
        // do somethin
        if (cond) {
            // do something
        }
        else {
            // error handling
        }
    } else {
        // error handling
    } else {
        error handling
    }
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Java Code

~~~~~~~~~~~~ java

int method() {

    try {
        // do something
        // do something
        // do something
    } catch (Exception1 e) {
        // error handling
    } catch (Exception2 e) {
        // error handling
    } catch ... {
        // error handling
    }

}

~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Propogating Error up the Call Stack
 * in C this is done using return values
 * hard to manage 
 * in java to handle use try/catch 
 * to propogate throw it

* Grouping and Differentiating Error Types
 * in C this is done by error code
 * hard to maintain 
 * Exception better for this


*Error/Exception Hierarchy*
* Throwable
 * Exception // check exception. Compiler forces the caller to handle the exceptions. eg IOException, InterruptedException, etc.
  * RuntimeException // uncheck exception. Compiler doesn't force. eg ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, ArithmeticException, etc.
 * Error // things where it is not possible to recover from. StackOverflow, etc.

*Creating your own Exceptions"

~~~~~~~~~~~ java

class MyException extends [Exception, RuntimeException] {

    // java suggest to make exceptions check if the user can reasonably recover from them
    // other reasons may include if it would be too cumbersome to force the user to handle then make unchecked
    // another reason might be if the user can avoid the exception through their code itself make it unchecked

    public MyException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }

}

~~~~~~~~~~~
 
*Throwing Exception*

* use throw new Exception("message");
* the place where you are throwing the Exception from you need to use throws Exception on the method/class
* you can also rethrow exceptions you catch


*try/catch/finally*

* try block is used to enclose all the statements that could throw exceptions
* catch block(s) could handle one or more Exceptions
* finally executes regaurdless of whether Exception arose or not
* it is used to do clean
* difference between finally and just adding code after the try/catch blocks is that finally is executed even if we return in the try catch block
* however finally is not executed if the runtime is stopped (using something like System.exit(0))

~~~~~~~~~~~~ java

try {
     
} catch (Exception1 &#124; Exception2 e) {

    e.printStackTrace(); // stops the program and prints the stack trace of the exception

} catch (Exception3 e) {

    throw e; // rethrow exception

} finally {

}
