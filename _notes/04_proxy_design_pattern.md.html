**Proxy Design Pattern**

* consider you have a class Database that is responsible for accessing the database
* you have 2 method in there read and write 
* each method first does authentication then authorization
* then it does the operation
* logs it and returns
* consider we make the following class

~~~~~~~~~~~~~ java

class Database {

    public void read() {
        DBSecurity.authenticate();
        DBSecurity.authorize();
        /*
            do read operations ... 
        */
        Logger.log();
    }


    public void write() {
        DBSecurity.authenticate();
        DBSecurity.authorize();
        /*
            do write operations ... 
        */
        Logger.log();
    }
}

~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* this doesn't offer good design because there is a tight coupling between the business logic and other logic
* if business logic is too be change one has to comb through all the other logic going through

So instead we make it so that the original class only does the actual logic

~~~~~~~~~~~~~ java

abstract class Database {

    public void read() {
        /*
            do read operations ... 
        */
    }


    public void write() {
        /*
            do write operations ... 
        */
    }

}

~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* then we extend a proxy class from this 
* the proxy class does all the other logic 
* when it needs the actual logic it just make a call to the super function

~~~~~~~~~~~~~ java

class DatabaseProxy extends Database {

    public void read() {
        DBSecurity.authenticate();
        DBSecurity.authorize();
        super.read(); // actual business logic in this function 
        Logger.log();
    }


    public void write() {
        DBSecurity.authenticate();
        DBSecurity.authorize();
        super.read(); // actual business logic in this function 
        Logger.log();
    }
}


~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* then anyone just instantiates the Proxy class and uses it to call the functions 
* when business logic is to be changed only the base class is modified
* the base class can be made abstract to prevent instantiation
