**Java Stream API**

* The java stream API is an API can allow various functions to be carried out on a stream consecutively
* The output of one is piped to the next and so on...
* This is done until a terminal function is reached that returns some result
* Stream API can be used on any Iterable collection
* The stream operations are lazy and are thus evaluated only when they are needed

*Using Stream API*

* .stream() function returns a stream on which now operations can be performed
* Then we can apply one of many non terminal functions one after another
 * .filter() takes in a predicate and filters the stream to only contain elements that satisfy the predicate (like selection)
 * .map() takes in an Object and returns an object of different type. (like projection)
 * .sorted() returns a sorted stream based on the compare function in the Object (if it implements Comparable interface) or we can 
 pass in a comparator function. (if both are present comparator function is given precedence)
* Finally we have non terminal operations
 * .collect() can be used to return a list, sum, average, etc.
 * .forEach() iterate all the elements of the stream, takes in a consumer 
 * .reduce() performs an aggregation function

*Other Functions*

* .removeIf() takes in a predicate and removes element if true
