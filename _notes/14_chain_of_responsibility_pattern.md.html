**Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern**

* In chain of responsibility the user of the API can instantiate instances of various classes
* Then they can define a chain of responsibility 
* A chain of responsibility essentially means that we call a method from the first class in the chain
* That class tries to carry it out, if it can't it calls the same method in the next class in the chain
* This goes until someone can solve the problem or we reach the end
* Then finally the result are propagated back 

*Example*

* consider we are making an ATM program
* we have classes for each denomination on currency
* each class has a withdraw method
* first we call the withdraw method on the first class in the chain
* if it can completely satisfy the request it return else if passes control to the next class in the chain
* it goes on till someone can complete the responsibility or we reach the end
