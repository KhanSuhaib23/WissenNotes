**Multithreading in Java**

* threads are state of execution through a process
* threads shares the same memory area as the process
* threads however do have their own stack
* threads also maintain their context information that stores the execution context of the thread
* by default each process has a single thread
* Java has 1 main thread and 21 background threads to handle JVM related things like garbage collection
* More threads can be created by the application

*Thread Creation in Java*

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ java

// old method

class ThreadTask implements Runnable { // runnable is a functional interface that has a function can run()

    // member variables
    // member functions

    public void run() {
        // code to run threaded
    }

}

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        Runnable task = new ThreadTask();

        Thread thread = new Thread(task); 

        thread.start(); // create a new thread and runs the run() method on it

        // this is the old method
        // extremely cumbersome
        // if some local variable values had to be used in the thread they 
        // have to be pass in through the constructor

        
        // method 2
        // using functional programming

        Runnable task = () -> {
            // can use final or effectively final variables in the scope
            // code to run threaded
        };

        Thread thread = new Thread(task, ["name"]);

        thread.start();



    }

}

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Thread Functions*

Functions |  Description
----------|----------------------------------------------------
otherthread.join() | The thread that called this function waits for the otherthread to complete before continuing 
otherthread.name() | The name of the thread. 
Thread.currentThread() | Returns a reference to the current thread object that the function was called in
thread.setPriority(val) | Default Value: 5, Minimum Value: 1, Maximum Value: 10
otherthread.interrupt() | sends an interrupt to the other thread. If the thread was in a state where it couldn't properly be interrupted it throws InterruptedException.
thread.isInterrupted() | returns true if the thread has been interrupted


*Sleep Function*

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ java

TimeUnit.{SECONDS | MILLISECONDS | MICROSECONDS | NANOSECONDS }.sleep(time to sleep in the preceding time unit)

// call this function in the thread you want to sleep
// a thread cannot make another sleep
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
*Race Condition*

* Race condition occurs due to unconstrained access of a common resource by more than one thread
* Usually operations on variable take place in different steps
 * Load (loads the value in the register)
 * Operate (operate on that data. If the operation modifies the data we could run into race conditions)
 * Write (if there was a modification write back the modified data)
* In race condition a situation could occur when the write back of one thread overwrites the changes made by another thread
* To prevent this shared resources can be constrained such that they can be accessed by a single variable
* In java one way to achieve this is using the sychronized keyword

*Synchronized*

* First we need to understand 2 things in java
 * First : Any object can be using as a lock object 
 * Second: Class is itself an object (accessed using either class-name.class or Class.forName("full class name")) 
* So let's see where all sychronized keyword can be placed and what are the consequences
* First we need to understand the synchronized block

~~~~~~~~~~ java

Object obj;

/* ... */

void someMethod() {
    //

    synchronized (obj) {
        // sychronized code
    }

    //
}

void someOtherMethod() {
    //

    synchronized (obj) {
        // some other synchronized code
    }

    //
}

// here what happens is code before entering the synchronized block it check whether 
// the lock on Object obj is available 
// if yes then it enter 
// else it waits on the object
// once the code exits the block any one of the many threads waiting on the obj enters the block
// the thread that enters is random (not FIFO)
// the obj can be of any type since all Class derived from the Object class

~~~~~~~~~~

* Next we will look at synchronized keyword at the instance method level

~~~~~~~~~~ java

class A {

    void synchronized a() {

    }

    void synchronized b() {

    }

}

// equivalent to 

class A {

    void a() {
        synchronized (this) {

        }
    }

    void b() {
        sychronized (this) {

        }
    }   

}

// this has one problem though 
// The instance is used as a lock of both the methods
// this means that if one thread is accessing the synchronized block of method a
// then another thread cannot access the synchronized block of method b using the same instance

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        A a = new A();
        
        Runnable r1 = () -> {
            a.a();
        }

        Runnable r2 = () -> {
            a.b();
        }

        Thread t1 = new Thread(r1);
        Thread t2 = new Thread(r2);

        t1.start(); // access a.a() 
        t2.start(); // has to wait to access a.b()

        // so even if methods a and b are independent they have to wait for each other


    }

}

// a better solution is methods a() and b() are independent

class A {

    private final Object syncA = new Object();
    private final Object syncB = new Object();

    void a() {
        synchronized (syncA) {

        }
    }

    void b() {
        sychronized (syncB) {

        }
    }   

    // thus now a and b can truly be independently called 
}


~~~~~~~~~~

!!! note
    If there is another method that is not synchronized it can be normally called without having to obtain a lock

*Synchronized on static methods*

~~~~~~~~~~ java

class A {

    public static synchronized void a() {

    }

    public static synchronized void b() {

    }

}

// here the synchronization is on class object
// there is a single class object per class
// the code is equivalent to 


class A {

    public static void a() {

        synchronized (A.class) {

        }

    }

    public static synchronized void b() {

        synchronized (A.class) {

        }

    }

}

// same problem as before but on a class level
// only one of these static methods can be called at a time
// huge performance issue
// solution (if methods a and b are independent)


class A {

    private static final Object syncA = new Object();
    private static final Object syncB = new Object();

    public static void a() {

        synchronized (syncA) {

        }

    }

    public static synchronized void b() {

        synchronized (syncB) {

        }

    }

}

~~~~~~~~~~

!!! note
    Same as before if there is another static method that isn't synchronized then it can be called normally without having to obtain any lock


*Issues with synchronized keywords*

* We cannot say say to wait on the synchronized block for n seconds else continue. Threads waiting on a synchronized block is blocked until it can get in
* We cannot release the lock without exiting the synchronized scope
* No concept of a shared lock, all locks are exclusive. So reader writer systems would be extremely inefficient.
* Therefore synchronized blocks are often complemented with wait and notify methods provided by Object class

*Wait and Notify*

* wait and notify are methods implemented by the Object class and are therefore present in every class 
* wait and notify methods can only be called if we are inside a synchronized block of the same object

~~~~~~~~~~~ java

// valid
synchronized (obj) {
    obj.wait();
    obj.notify();
}

// invalid
obj.wait();
obj.notify();

// invalid
synchronized (other) {
    obj.wait();
    obj.notify();
}

~~~~~~~~~~~

Method | Description
-------|--------------
obj.wait | The current thread releases the lock on obj it currently hold and get blocked. Waiting for a some other to notify it. Once notified it recaptured the lock before continuing execution
obj.notify | The current thread notifies any random waiting thread so they can continue their execution. 
obj.notifyAll | Notifies all the threads waiting on the object

*Volatile*

* variables marked volatile are not cached
* that means changes to these variables are always visible instantly to all other threads
* just because a variable is synchronized doesn't garuantee synchronization though
* race conditions can still occur

*Deadlock*

* occurs when one thread has acquired resource A and wants resource B and another thread has acquired resource B and wants resource A
* solved by introducing a randomized waiting period after which the thread give up trying to obtain the other resource and try again after sometime
* can introduce major delays
* Or by making sure all resource acquisition happens all at once
* That is thread X tries to acquire A and B at the same time. If it can't acquire either one it gives up and tries again after some time
* Or follow a acquire1 release1 acquire2 release2 pattern instead of acquire1 acquire2 release1 release2 pattern


*New Multithreading Support in Java*

* all the above methods are the old way of doing multithreading and concurrency in java
* the main problems with the above methods are performance based
* creating a thread is an expensive process, so creating anew Thread every time one needs it and then destroying it when its task completes is incredibly wasteful
* synchronized object also dont support by default shared locks
* the new methods includes creating thread pools and locks 
* these threads pools and locks can be implemented using standard synchronized object and the Thread class

*Thread Pools*

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ java

// The default thing that is used is an executor service that holds a thread pool instance
// There are many types of thread pools available as through the Executors factory
// Following are some of the most used ones

ExecutorService threadPool = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
// can create a single worker thread at a time having a single unbounded queue 

ExecutorService threadPool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(n);
// create a new thread pool that reuses n number of threads of a shared unbounded queue

ExecutorService threadPool = Executors.newCachedThreadPool();
// this thread pool create as many thread as need, but once a thread is finished it isn't destroyed 
// the threads are cached to be reused later. If no new job arrives for 90 seconds then the threads destroyed

// To create a thread to run in a thread pool we must use the submit method

// All of these above methods can also take a non default thread factory that it calls when creating new thread
// They also have a version that returns a ScheduledExecutorService wherein threads can be submitted to run after a delay

threadPool.submit(runnable);

// We can also submit a callable
// Callable is an interface like Runnable but can return results and throw Exceptions

Future&lt;String&gt; res = threadPool.submit(callable);

// future object can be used to query things like isComplete or isCancelled


// submitting multiple Callables at the same time

Collection&lt;Callable&lt;Future&lt;String&gt;&gt;&gt; callables = Arrays.asList(callable1, callable2, callable3, ...);

List&lt;Future&lt;String&gt;&gt; futureResults = 
threadPool.invokeAll(callables); // runs all the callables in the list of tasks that were invoked

for (Future&lt;String&gt; res : futureResults) {
    String str = res.get(); // gets the result when available

    // or

    String str = res.get(n, TimeUnit.SECONDS); // waits for n seconds to get the result 
    // if not available till then returns null and continues

threadPool.shutDown(); // when not needed anymore the thread pool should be shutdown

}

*Problems with thread pools*

* No default option to join so that we could have one thread waiting one the others
* No default option for multiple threads to wait at a single point until other threads also reach that point
* For the first problem we use a countdown latch for the second problem we use a CyclicBarrier

*CountDownLatch*

* CountDownLatch latch can be initialized with a value and then a thread can be made to wait on the latch which can continue when the value of the latch reaches 0
* Each thread upon which the main thread has to wait decreements the latch when it is done with its task


~~~~~~~~~~ java

class Counter {
    private int count;

    public synchronized void increement() {
        count++;
    }

    public int get() { return count; }
}

void CountDownLatchDemo() {

    Counter counter = new Counter();

    int nthread = 100;

    CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(nthread);

    Runnable task = () -> { 
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 1000; i++) {
            counter.increement();
        }

        latch.countDown();
    };

    ExecutorService threadPool = Executors.newCachedThreadPool();

    for (int i = 0; i &lt; nthread; i++) {
        threadPool.submit(task);
    }

    latch.await(); // we want to wait for all the threads to complete the counting up before getting the final result

    int finalRes = counter.get();
}

~~~~~~~~~~

*CyclicBarrier*

* What if we want many threads to wait at a particular point until all the other threads also reach that point
* Here we can use the CyclicBarrier

~~~~~~~~~ java

void cyclicBarrierDemo() {

    int nthread = 100;

    CyclicBarrier cbarrier = new CyclicBarrier(nthread);

    Runnable task = () -> {
        int count = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 1000; i++) {
            count++;
        }

        cbarrier.await(); // waits for nthreads to reach this point before every thread continues ahead together 
    };

    ExecutorService threadPool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(nthread);

    for (int i = 0; i &lt; nthread; i++) {
        threadPool.submit(task);
    }
}

~~~~~~~~~

!!! note
    CyclicBarriers require some Exception handling code that is not provided here

*Locks*

* The primary lock used is called the Reentrant lock
* It allows us to lock (which blocks) tryLock (which doesn't block)
* tryLock can also be used to make the thread wait for a certain time if it cannot obtain the lock it continues
* Once a lock is obtained it can be unlocked at any point
* The queue for blocked threads can also be either made fair (FIFO, has a performance hit) or not

~~~~~~~~~ java

void lockDemo() {
    Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();
    
    Runnable task = () -> {

        try {
            lock.lock();

            // some code that can throw exception
        } catch (Exception e) {
            // handle Exception
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }

    }
}

~~~~~~~~~

[ReentrantLock Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/locks/ReentrantLock.html)

*Semaphore*

* Semaphore can be said to be a resource gate
* it is said to have a given 'n' value that can be said to represent some n number of resources
* A thread can try to acquire some 'm' number of resources
* If enough resources are not available then the thread is blocked
* Else the available count is decreemented by the value and the thread enters
* Generally used if we only want certain number of threads to enter a particular block at a time

~~~~~~~ java

void producerConsumer() {

    final int MAX_SIZE = 100;

    Semaphore canProduce = new Semaphore(MAX_SIZE); // at the start the queue is empty, so he can produce MAX_SIZE products
    Semaphore canConsume = new Semaphore(0); // at start no elements in the array so cannot consume anything

    Runnable producer = () -> {

        while (true) {
            canProduce.acquire(1); // see if there is space to produce
            
            // produce and add to queue

            canConsume.release(1); // tell any consumer that they have one more product to consume
        }
        
    }

    Runnable consumer = () -> {

        while (true) {
            canConsume.acquire(1);

            // consume and remove from queue

            canProduce.release(1); // tell any produce that there is one more space available

        }
    }

    ExecutorService threadPool = Executors.fixedThreadPool(2);

    threadPool.submit(producer);
    threadPool.submit(consumer);

    threadPool.shutDown();

}

[Semaphore Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Semaphore.html)

*Conditions*

* conditions can be created from lock
* conditions are additional synchronization object on which a thread can await or signal
* await and signal can be both called only when the corresponding lock has be acquired
* await releases the corresponding lock and block until it recieves a signal
* signal signals any thread awaiting on the given condition

~~~~~~~~~~ java

void conditionsDemo() {

    List&lt;String&gt; buffer = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(); 

    // say we have 2 functions isFull and isEmpty
    // they do the obvious things
    
    Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();

    Condition notFull = lock.newCondition();
    Condition notEmpty = lock.newCondition();

    Runnable producer = () -> {
        while (true) {
            lock.lock();

            if (isFull(buffer)) {
                notFull.await(); // block until someone signals that buffer is notFull 
            }
            // producer and add

            notEmpty.signal(); // signal that the buffer is notEmpty 
        }
    }

    Runnable consumer = () -> {
        while (true) {
            lock.lock();

            if (isEmpty(buffer)) {
                notEmpty.await(); // block until someone signals that buffer is notFull 
            }
            // consume and remove

            notEmpty.signal(); // signal that the buffer is notEmpty 
        }
    }

    ExecutorService threadPool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2);

    threadPool.submit(produce);
    threadPool.submit(consume);

    threadPool.shutDown();

}

~~~~~~~~~~

*ReadWriteLock*

* multiple reads can happen at the same time
* only a single write can happen at a time
* when writing no reads can happen
* thus we could say reads require shared locks and writes require exclusive locks
* java provides a inbuilt way to do this

~~~~~~~~~~ java

void readWriteLockDemo() {

    ReentrantReadWriteLock readWriteLock = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();

    Lock readLock = readWriteLock.readLock();
    Lock writeLock = readWriteLock.writeLock();

    Runnable writeTask = () -> {
        writeLock.lock();

        // write operation
        
        writeLock.unlock();
    };


    Runnable readTask = () -> {
        readLock.lock();

        // read operation
        
        readLock.unlock();
    };

    ExecutorService threadPool = Executors.newCachedThreadPool();

    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 50; i++) {
        if (i % 2 == 0) threadPool.submit(writeTask);
        else threadPool.submit(runTask);
    }

    threadPool.shutDown();
}
