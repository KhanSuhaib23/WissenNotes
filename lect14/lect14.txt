------ Serialization ------

Java Object -> Binary Format / Byte Stream to store or transfer

implements Serializable (marker interface)

Get a Object{}Stream and then convert from and to objects

Then put in file using a stream file writer

Serializable should be recursive

implements Externalizable (not marker class) extends Serializable

	|
	|---> writeExternal 
	|
	|---> readExternal // additional object to read and write doesn't work apparently
