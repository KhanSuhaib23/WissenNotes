sqlplus is a tool to connect to a server/database

when we first login it first connects to the metadata table checks credentials and then connect to the specified schema.

listener.ora is a file that always resides on the server and listens to all the requests also does all the authentication

tnsnames.ora file is on the client side it will has the details to connect the the server (IP address, machine address, etc)


The file are at

C:\app\Nexwave\ (the user it was installed for)

|---> product\11.2.0\dbhome_1\: stores all the binary for the software to work
|		|---> NETWORK\ADMIN: has the tnsnames.ora
|
|---> 


To get specific paths then we use manual method in which a script is created to create the db

Default oracle port is 1521

SERVER: could be either DEDICATED (default) or SHARED


8i  -> i = internet
9i  -> i = intelligent
10g -> g = grid
11g -> g = grid
12c -> c = cloud

	|
	|----> cdb: container database
	|
	|----> pdb: pluggable database

select = selection (row) + projection (column)

for select on multiple table use join


Clauses
	|
	|----> SELECT: gives the columns/alias/expressions
	|
	|----> FROM  : gives the table name


-> SQL statements are not case sensitive
-> can be one or more lines
-> clauses are usually placed on seperate line

-> -- for comments

Expressions

	'+' : adds lhs and rhs.
	    : lhs, rhs could be columns or literals but have to be numerical

	'-' : 'same'
	
	'*' : 'same'
	
	'/' : 'same'

Precendence:
	* / [>] + -
	Same priority then left to right
	Can be changed using ()

NULL values are values that are unavailable, unassigned, unknown or inapplicable.

NULL is not 0 or blank space

value of NULL is NULL

an arithmetic expression containing NULL always evaluates to NULL

column aliasing 

	select last_name as lname, first_name as "First Name", commission comn from .....;

	"string" string is case sensitive
	as is not necessaery
	AS is a clause

Concatenate

concatenate the results in the columns

a || b || c ... 

a, b, c ... : could be column (any type) or literals

			: numerical literals are as in 2000

			: string literals are 'string'


Alternate Quote Operation (from 10g)

in string literal problem comes when we use ' in the string

to use Quote Operator

q'[<string>]'
q'{<string>}'
q'(<string>)'

any of the above is fine

<string> can have special characters like '

Distinct

	Clause to get distinct rows


Where
	select <>
	from <>
	[where <condition>] // optional

strings: '<string>' case sensitive
data   : 'DD-MON-YY' 

comparsion conditions

	=
	>
	>=
	<
	<=
	<> // not equal
	=! // not equal
	BETWEEN ... AND ... // values are inclusive
	LIKE // regex matching
	IS NOT NULL // all the not nulls
	IS NULL // all the nulls
	IN ( , , , ) // true if matches any
	NOT IN ( , , , ) // true if there were no matches, NULL values are not selected

LIKE '<regex>'

<regex>: % -> any number of wild card character (0 to inf)
		 _ -> one wild card character

		 wild card character matches with any character

Comparision Connectors

AND 
OR 
NOT


connection: connecting from one machine to another through a network
session   : the time from log in (start) to log out (end)

If connection is lost session goes away

Session can be started and end multiple time on the same ongoing connection

Data will be in memory if is in MRU (most recently used)
Data may or may not be in memory if is in LRU (least recently used)
