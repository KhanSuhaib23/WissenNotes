------- Web Application -------

JEE
	Servlet
	JSP

Architecture
	MVC
		--> Model: business data
				Layers
					|
					|---> Persistence Layer
					|
					|---> Service Layer

		--> View: the presentation. Should not be tightly coupled with Model

		--> Controller: broker between Model and View

Web Application should have war packaging

Java Localhost server 2s for response

@RequestMapping(value = url, method = RequestMethod.{}, params = {"paramnames [[!]= value]", ...}, 
				headers= {"header-name[=value]"}, consumes = {"media type", ...})

@RequestParam (required, defaultValue="val") param-type param-name

param-name and request name should match

@ModelAttribute ModelClass modelname

if (consumes = application/xml) use @RequestBody and the Model needs to be annotated on JAXB

// and we have to do @EnableWebMvc

BindingResult to get the errors on incorrect client data

system and system path doesnt work for web apps

Therefore put all the jar dependencies inside webapps > WEB-INF > lib
